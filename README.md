## Overview
Welcome to the **Valorant Cheats** repository! This project provides advanced tools for Valorant, including a powerful **Valorant aimbot**, **Valorant ESP**, **Valorant wallhack**, and other hacks. Built with C++ and memory manipulation techniques.

## Features
- **Valorant Aimbot**: Smooth aiming with customizable FOV, bone targeting (head, body), and prediction for moving targets. Undetected against Vanguard.
- **Valorant Wallhack**: See enemies through walls with color-coded outlines (red for enemies, green for teammates).
- **Valorant ESP**: Displays player info like health, distance, weapons, and abilities in real-time overlays.
- **Valorant Triggerbot**: Auto-fires when crosshair is on an enemy.
- **Recoil Control & No-Spread**: Eliminates weapon recoil and bullet spread.
- **Skin Changer & Radar Hack**: Customize agent skins and get a mini-map radar for enemy positions.
- **Bypass Vanguard**: Methods to evade Riot's anti-cheat (e.g., kernel-level injection).

All features configurable via an in-game menu. Optimized for Windows 10/11.
